# Stage 3 Dissertation

---

For my final project in 3rd year, I wrote a dissertation entitled "Investigating a Genetic Algorithm for Non-Player Character Navigation". I recieved an overall mark of 81% for the disseration module.

This explored using a genetic algorithm to allow for enemies to move around a game map, without the need to set up a NavMesh or implement a pathfinding algorithm.

---

Tasks involved:
- Creating the Unity environment
- Implementing the genetic algorithm
- Implementing different observations of the agents
- Implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm for comparison.
- Setting up the NavMesh for comparison
- Creating a training environment
- Creating scripts to store test data
- Producing graphs based on the recorded data
- Analysing the data

Scripts were written in C#.

One aspect of this module was the project proposal. I recieved a mark of 85% for this aspect of the module. I really enjoyed this part of the module as I was able to research the current state of AI in the games industry, and learn about how it was used. It also helped me to consider the scope of projects and planning my time accordingly.

We were asked to provide a presentation, part way through the project. I recieved a mark of 9.5/10, and the feedback recieved described the presentation as "professional quality".
