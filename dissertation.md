## Stage 3 Dissertation

For my final project in 3rd year, I wrote a dissertation entitled "Investigating a Genetic Algorithm for NonPlayer Character Navigation"

This explored using a genetic algorithm to allow for enemies to move around a game, without the need to set up a NavMesh, or implement a pathfinding algorithm.

Tasks involved:
- Creating the Unity environment
- Implementing the genetic algorithm
- Implementing different observations of the agents
- Implmeneting the A* pathfinding algorithm for comparison.
- Setting up the NavMesh for comparison
