## CSC8501 - Advanced Programming for Games

---

This project was the coursework submission for the CSC8501 - Advanced Programming for Games module at Newcastle University.

I was given a range of tasks, based on the Beal Conjecture. I had to write a program in C++ to complete the tasks. For this coursework I recieved a mark of 100%

Tasks included:
- Computing values and testing if they satisfy a conjecture.
    - Finding prime values.
    - Finding values within ranges.
    - Finding composite values.
    - Finding square numbers between 1000 and 100,000.
    - Finding the highest possible value that still satisfies the conjecture.
- Reading and writing to files.
- Generating ASCII representations of histograms.
