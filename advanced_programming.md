## CSC8501 - Advanced Programming for Games

This project includes the coursework submission for the CSC8501 - Advanced Programming for Games module at Newcastle University.

I was given a range of tasks, based on the Beal Conjecture. I had to write a program in C++ to address the tasks.

For this coursework I recieved full marks.
