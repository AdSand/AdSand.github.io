## Team Game Jam (January 2024)

This project involved working in a team to create a Unity game.

The game jam was to create a game based on the phrase "It's Spreading". The game jam is currently on-going.

Taks that I have completed as part of the project so far:
- UI
- Animation
- Character movement
- Helping with game design
- Scene Management
