## Team Game Jam (January 2024)

---

This project involved working in a team to create a small Unity game. The game jam specified to create a game based on the phrase "It's Spreading". 

The game jam lasted two weeks and I worked with four other people to produce the final product.

A valuable skill I learned throughout this project was using version control (git) successfully in a team. This included branch management, merging branches and solving merge conflicts.

This project provided an opportunity to work with code written by other team members, and writing code that would be used by other team members. This improved how I thought about the structure and writing of my code, such as following a coding standard, providing readable code, and generalising functions that could be used elsewhere in the project.
