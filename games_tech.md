# CSC3232 - Gaming Technologies and Simulations

---

This project includes the coursework submission for the CSC3232 - Gaming Technologies and Simulations module at Newcastle University.
This involved creating a game in Unity. I decided on a platformee game, in the style of Crash Bandicoot and the Lego Games.

For this coursework I recieved a mark of 92%

Included Features:
- Player movement
- Enemy pathfinding
- Enemy state machines
- Min/Max enemy AI for final boss
- Mini-game logic (shoot all targets, move balls to correct location, etc...)
- Menu system
- Cellular automata to create water effect on the menu
- Flocking birds

---

This game had a start menu and end screen menu, where the game could be restarted or the player could return to the main menu.

Overall I was very proud of this project, and was happy to create a finished game that could be played from start to finish, with win and lose conditions.
